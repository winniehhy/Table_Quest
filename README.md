<h3>🌟Table Quest</h3>
<p> Welcome to Table Quest, our entry for the Make It Challenge Hackathon Web 3.0. Table Quest is a sophisticated, gamified restaurant booking application designed to enhance user experience by allowing token claims and minimizing time wasted in overcrowded queues at popular dining establishments. Leveraging blockchain technology, the app provides real-time updates on the current occupancy and estimated waiting times at restaurants, offering users valuable insights for better decision-making. </p>


<br>
<h3>💡Idea Pitch</h3>

<p>Table Quest aims to revolutionize the dining experience by offering: </p>

<p><b>->Real-Time Transparency</b>: See live updates on table availability and waiting times. </p>
<p><b>->Enhanced Efficiency</b>: Streamlined booking process reduces waiting times and optimizes restaurant operations. </p>
<p><b>->Environmental Impact</b>: By reducing the need for cars to idle while waiting for a table, we help lower carbon emissions. </p>
</br>
