<h3>Table Quest</h3>
<p> 🌟 Welcome to Table Quest, our entry for the Make It Challenge Hackathon Web 3.0. Table Quest is a gamified booking app leveraging blockchain technology to provide real-time transparency, enhance efficiency, and reduce long queues. This app not only saves customers time and money but also contributes to net zero by lowering carbon emissions from cars. </p>


<br>
<h3>💡Idea Pitch</h3>
Table Quest aims to revolutionize the dining experience by offering:
</br>

<br>🚨
<b>Real-Time Transparency</b>: See live updates on table availability and waiting times.
<b>Enhanced Efficiency</b>: Streamlined booking process reduces waiting times and optimizes restaurant operations.
<b>Environmental Impact</b>: By reducing the need for cars to idle while waiting for a table, we help lower carbon emissions.
